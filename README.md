# Git hub to record all learnings and trying code during course etc. 
Almost none of these are original by me. Might have modified or changed either to experiment or to work on the class. 
Collected learnings over last few years.
At times if possible, I would have README.md inside each subdirectory for where the course was, what was it about and any references. If not, online search would find.
